        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Veganuary: When Ethics Clash with Disordered Eating</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">January 11, 2019 by Charlea Harrison</p>
        <p>So here we are, already one whole mammoth-month deep into 2019. I’ve been thinking about the topic of this post almost constantly throughout January, and even in the months leading up to it. As a vegetarian with an extremely complicated and relationship with food, I always knew that transitioning to a vegan diet would be equally complicated. So I didn’t do it. Didn’t even try, in fact – and I have no regrets.</p>
        <p>That intro probably seems like I’m about to start vegan-bashing, which is absolutely not true. The ethics of a vegan lifestyle is, quite frankly, goals. I’d love for that to be my lifestyle. I follow lots of vegan accounts across social media because I find the whole movement, and the strength that it is galvanising, very inspiring. Seeing stats on the increasing number of vegetarians and vegans in the world warms my heart with the tiniest shred of hope that we might actually be able to slow down the cataclysmic ecosystem failure that our planet is facing. I watched the documentary Land of Hope and Glory last year and obstinately decided that I would complete – not even just attempt – Veganuary, and continue the lifestyle thereafter. Honourable intentions, sure, but I was forgetting the most important agent in this whole agenda – my own body and mind.</p>
        <p>Having established that I am absolutely an advocate of plant-based living and depending as little as personally viable on animal products, I want to discuss the restriction it inhabits. Veganism, like vegetarianism, is a restrictive diet. It is restrictive for ethical reasons, but that doesn’t prevent the fact that it is inherently restrictive. Restriction is the entire point – you are cutting out entire food groups, labelling them as ‘bad’ and ‘no-go’ foods, attributing a sense of shame to the consumption of those foods. This is absolutely my attitude towards meat, and it aligns with my ethics. At the time I decided to become vegetarian, I didn’t even think about the impact that this restriction might have on my relationship with food.</p>
        <p>When I remember the amount of time, pain, stress and anxiety that was consumed by my over-restrictive diet, I wonder why on earth I didn’t seriously take this into account when transitioning to vegetarianism. Truth is, the nutrients I was losing didn’t relate all that much to my past fears of food. I made this change whilst in the depths of exploring weight-training and trying to make #gainz – a lifestyle which was naturally (in my mind) impacted by cutting out 90% of my protein intake. In my obsessions with macronutrients, I saw meat as purely protein, and cutting it out meant only that I’d have to source protein from elsewhere to fuel my #fitnessgoals. Perhaps I was just in a good place with my eating, but I really believe that the nutritional make up of this food group was largely responsible for why giving it up didn’t affect me mentally. However, I want to press on the fact that this may not be the case for all people. Restriction is restriction, and whether or not I was able to cope with it, that may not be the story for many others.</p>
        <p>So here I am having made a huge deal of the restriction involved in giving up meat. Good lord, imagine now giving up everything that contains any trace of animal produce. That’s a lot of food off your plate. And, if you think of the products that you automatically associate with dairy – cheese, butter, cakes, ice cream – there’s a trend to be seen. When I watched Land of Hope and Glory and declared my future veganism, I thought about what I’d have to cut out and how I would navigate this new lifestyle. When I realised I would no longer eat cookies, biscuits, cakes, and basically every other delicious snack (except for vegan options), I got a pang of excitement for the amount of fat and sugar I’d be cutting out. I envisioned a 2019 where I was at optimum health, practiced clean eating and lost a few pounds in the process. This honestly sounded like a dream.</p>
        <p>Truth is, it was a dream. When I decided to be as vegan as possible to prepare myself for Veganuary, I tested myself by resisting cookies whenever they were in the house. When I ultimately ate a cookie, I was so angry at myself. Filled with guilt, shame and self-resentment, I couldn’t stop thinking about the impact this would have on my calories in/out balance, how the added fat to my daily food would automatically make me gain weight. Hold up. What?</p>
        <p>I didn’t think at all about the milk and butter that had gone into those cookies that had come from the animals I was supposedly fighting for. Truth be told, in that moment I didn’t care – I’d eaten a goddam cookie and my body was about to pay the price. It was after this incident that I realised I was using veganism not as an ethical lifestyle, but as a diet tool masqueraded as being ‘good for me’. In my mind, the logic of supporting animals, the planet, and myself with all the natural whole foods I’d be eating, meant it was a no-lose situation. That would potentially be the case, if it weren’t for the fact that diet culture is so ingrained within me that I subconsciously manipulated an ethical decision into a desperate plan to lose weight.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Now, I’m fortunate in recognising this. I honestly think a year ago this realisation wouldn’t have occurred to me and I’d be full-steam ahead on the vegan train. Maybe it would have been fine, improved my skin, made me more energised, cleared my conscience – but maybe that would have come at the cost of my relationship with food and my body, not to say all of the progress I’d made in recovery. I am fortunate in the voices I listen to and the influences I take in. In the ‘Veganuary Special’ episode of Talking Tastebuds, vegan author Kim-Julie Hansen discusses the prevalence of vegan influencers who use veganism as way of encouraging orthorexia as a healthy lifestyle choice. After expressing her love of vegan junk food (finally, someone has done it), she criticises the culture of veganism adopted by many that focuses on juice cleanses, detoxes and intermittent fasting. One more time for those in the back please.</p>
        <p>More recently, I began reading Laura Thomas’ new book Just Eat It. The cover boasts the slogan, ‘how intuitive eating can help you get your shit together around food’. Um, yes please, sign me up. I bought it immediately and this thing is pure gold. Seriously, like, how is it that every damn sentence is stating exactly how I’ve felt around food for years? – Anyway, circling back; Laura Thomas gives a modern take on diet culture and the many ways it embeds itself in how we eat.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <span class="quote>">‘In a world where ‘diet’ has become such a dirty word that even Weight Watchers have dropped it, pursuit of weight loss has become passé and people have ditched diets in favour of the more rarefied and esoteric ‘lifestyle’ movements like clean eating, wellness and even veganism. In an attempt to distance ourselves from overt dieting, we have developed new, creative ways to engage in disordered eating behaviours.’</span>
          <span class="page">Laura Thomas, Just Eat It, p. 28.</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>My god. If that’s not a word for word account of my attitude towards food in the past year, I don’t know what is. To be clear – Laura Thomas is not denouncing veganism as an ethical choice whatsoever. She simply criticises its appropriation as a diet technique, and I’m all here for it.</p>
        <p>It seems that a lot of people are finally on board with shutting down diet culture and criticising the impact it has on our relationship with our bodies, yet we’re reluctant to admit that it has seeped into other avenues of our eating choices. While many fitness influencers are chugging the spirulina and goji berries, there’s very little conversation on the impacts this can have on our mental health. This absence of discussion is what leads many people (like myself) to feel guilty for not being ‘good’ enough – in regards to either health or ethics – unaware that this is the same guilt that feeds a desire to make ourselves thin.</p>
        <p>So, while I header this post with a picture of my vegan, healthy looking breakfast, know that this was my breakfast of choice because it gives me energy and stamina (and porridge with peanut butter is life). After that, I was immediately excited about the strawberry custard creams I have in my cupboard, because who the hell doesn’t need strawberry custard creams in their life? I even dared to make the decision to dunk some in my tea. Maybe you’re not a dunker – if so, don’t hate – but those are the only kind of food choices I want to be making.</p>
