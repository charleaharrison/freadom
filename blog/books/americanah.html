        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Review: Americanah, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">January 14, 2019 by Charlea Harrison</p>
        <p>When I first read Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche’s book-length essay, ‘We Should All Be Feminists’, I knew I needed more. With her articulate and powerful writing, I was hooked, and immediately bought Americanah. This was a year ago. Despite my irrefutable bookishness, the near-500 pages of small text had me subconsciously postponing picking it up. Rookie error, given that I now wish the book had been even longer.</p>
        <p>Americanah is a novel about Nigerian identity; both in itself and in its hybrid forms with Western identity. Whilst it follows a story of timeless love, the novel is fascinating and intellectual in its exploration of Nigerian identity and race. Alongside the charming story of Ifemulu and Obinze’s lives, there runs the inquisitive and often critical commentary of social norms across continents. Needless to say, it is a love story with a big voice. In each uncomfortable dialogue about issues of race and racialised attitudes in Western countries, Adiche seamlessly interweaves discussions of the matters that so clearly concern her most. From reading her ‘We Should All Be Feminists’, I hear Adiche’s analytical and explorative tone clearly in her questioning of racialised and gendered representation throughout the novel. Nonetheless, this does not take away from the genuine authenticity of her characters, who each bring their own unique insight to the table.</p>
        <p>The novel so clearly emulates the life of Adiche herself through Ifemulu’s experiences growing up in Nigeria, before having her entire self-perception upturned after she moves to America. There’s something totally polarising about the clash between American and Nigerian identities; equally proud and culture-bound. However, contrast inhabits a jarring imbalance when Ifemulu moves to America. Whilst I expected to see more overt racism in the novel by white characters, instead Adiche focuses on the cultural shifts. This often results in non-racist individuals nonetheless exhibiting arguably problematic views. Ifemulu’s white employer, Kimberley, whose children Ifemulu cares for, is the perfect example. Whilst undeniably holding good intentions, Kimberley reflects many liberal mindsets in her compassionate but often naive and unconsciously patronising tone.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <span class="quote">“At first, Ifemelu thought Kimberly’s apologizing sweet, even if unnecessary, but she had begun to feel a flash of impatience, because Kimberly’s repeated apologies were tinged with self-indulgence, as though she believed that she could, with apologies, smooth all the scalloped surfaces of the world.”</span>
          <span class="page">p. 163</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This passage in particular makes me think of the growing discussions around white saviourism in the media. We are becoming increasingly conscious of the naivety in thinking that one can be either ‘racist’ or ‘not racist’; our perceptions of race are inherently complex through the power imbalance that has been ingrained in us. Kimberley means well, but Ifemulu’s frustration is essential in teaching us that this isn’t enough. In contrast to Ifemulu’s experience, Obinze’s friends in Britain uphold strong-middle class pride and discuss racial issues in an airy, ‘educated’ way. At Emenike’s dinner party, the conversations held are incredibly interesting, though nonetheless uncomfortable as opinions awkwardly clash. This is made ever-more poignant in juxtaposition with Obinze’s imminent deportation, and his bitter struggle through migrant life. When he is being deported, Obinze makes a raw observation on the language in this event:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <span class="quote">“[The lawyer] was going to tick on a form that his client was willing to be removed. “Removed.” That word made Obinze feel inanimate. A thing to be removed. A thing without breath and mind. A thing.”</span>
          <span class="page">p. 279</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Adiche’s exploration in cultural differences between Nigerian and Western identity spans much further than race alone. Particularly in Ifemulu’s introduction to America, the cultural differences in perceptions of mental health and wellbeing are rife:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <span class="quote">“Depression was what happened to Americans, with their self-absolving need to turn everything into an illness. She was not suffering from depression; she was merely a little tired and a little slow. […] Nobody in Kinshasa had panic attacks. It was not even that it was called by another name, it was simply not called at all. Did things begin to exist only when they were named?”</span>
          <span class="page">p. 158</span>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This period of Ifemulu’s life was very difficult to read. To witness her slowly deteriorate into a shell of her former self, having been indoctrinated to dispute the validity of mental illness, was heartbreaking. Particularly in her immersion into a whole new life, the loneliness she faces is almost contagious. In this context, I genuinely admire her strength in pulling through. However, despite its sadness, this extract reminds us of Ifemulu’s constant consciousness of cultural differences of identity. From her confusion in navigating American dialect, to her utter shock at the concept of the thin ideal body image, Ifemulu faces cultural barriers at every turn, with little support from others in breaking them down. This is particularly true in her Auntie Uju, who appears to shift seamlessly into American life and consequently causes Ifemulu to feel even more alienated.</p>
        <p>Auntie Uju is actually my favourite character. I surprised myself in this because I usually go for the classic feminist hero who takes no shit and tells it like it is, which would undoubtedly be Ifemulu (who I LOVE). My interest in Auntie Uju is less fan-girly and more fascination. She is perhaps the most fluctuating character in the whole book – not in terms of Adiche’s writing consistency, but in Uju’s rocky life experiences and her constant need to adapt. With her multitude of relationships, fleeing Nigeria in a state of emergency, and bringing up her son Dike in American whilst scraping through her studies, Uju clearly as a difficult life. From entering the story as Ifemulu’s soft-natured, blessed Auntie, she becomes roughened at the edges by the struggles of her life, gaining sensational strength in her autonomy. She may not be the frilliest character, but Uju is strong, persistent, and opinionated – she embodies the reality of struggle, reminding us that we will do whatever we can to survive.</p>
        <p>I could talk forever about this book, it is truly fascinating. Coming from a white background with little-to-no diversity in my home town, it’s refreshing to encounter such a powerful voice breaking down the barriers in cross-continent identity. Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche is truly a wonder, and I’ll certainly be picking up more of her work soon.</p>
